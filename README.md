# TFT Auto Buy
TFT Auto Buy is a simple python script that autobuys champions based on your composition.
The algorithm takes a screenshot each second and detects available champion from the current champion pool, then clicks to the right panel.

## How do I make it works ?
You will have to install Python 3 in order to make it start.
You can download it [here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Start it using the following command: `./ocr_tft.py Champion1 Champion2 Champion3 ...`

## Is it detectable ?
Yes, because of the inhuman reaction (~ 0.2 second) between a reroll, analyze of the champion pool and click(s). Putting a longer timer is counterproductive, just play the game instead.
Although I had fun developing this tool, I take no responsability in case of ban, permanent or not.
Use it at your own risks.

### Thank you for using my simple (yet interesting) cheating tool
